## Brief overview
* Gary wants a mobile app to be installed by students in a specific classroom. They will sign up and give their demographic information. 
* Their movements will be tracked inside a pre-configured classroom, like the chairs, tables etc can be set in a classroom in the app.

* At the end of the class, they will be presented with a survey about their specific movements, e.g. Why did you move 
from this table to that chair etc. Most of the things should be customizable in this system, like chairs, tables, survey questions.
