# Student Symposium
##### Where?
Student Center

##### Who was present?
Ben, Vanessa, and Cody

##### When?
April 9th, 12-3:30

## Why?
We had to and it was an opportunity to show off our work

## What all happened
We had all of our equipment set up the Monday before the symposium, 
Equipment consisted of:
  - Laptops with the app, webpage, and admin page.
  - Handouts that could be grabbed in case they wanted to.
  - Poster
  
When people walked around we had to explain what our project was and what it will be used for. Although most of the projects
there were about already performed experiments to prove something, our projects are mainly the basis of what experiments 
will be based on. Talking about our project wasnt too difficult, explaining to people that our project isnt based on results
was the difficult part.

## What was our opinion?
We thought it went over quite well, but as said before our projects are more for testing a thesis, and not the results of one.
Should we do it again? Honestly I wouldn't think so, but thats just my opinion.
