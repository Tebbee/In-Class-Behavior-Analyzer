### Project Overview

* Gary wants a mobile app to be installed by students in a specific classroom. Students will sign up using their Ball State login information and give their demographic information. 
* Their movements will be tracked inside a pre-configured classroom, like the chairs, tables etc can 
be set in a classroom in the app. 
* At the end of the class period, students will be presented with a survey about their specific movements, e.g. 
* Why did you move from this table to that chair etc. Most of the things should be customizable in this system, like chairs, tables, survey questions.
